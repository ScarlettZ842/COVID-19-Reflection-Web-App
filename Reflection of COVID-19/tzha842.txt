In my "NZ COVID-19 Cases Tracker" website, I divided the webpage into three areas. 

The first area demonstrates some trivial information of NZ COVID-19, such as this website logo, the NZ cases information updated date,
the current national alert level and the link to jump to the other website and fetch more detailed cases data.

The second area uses the list and numbers to directly represent NZ COVID-19 cases. The top case statistics section shows the total cases,
recovered cases, new cases today, deaths cases, new deaths cases as well as serious cases of the latest day seperately, the displayed data will also 
be updated everyday. And the list illustrates each days statistics in reverse order, users can obviously browse the latest data and scroll 
down to scan the earlier cases data.

The thrid area is comprised with two graphs. One graph is a line graph which exhibits NZ total deaths cases, users can distinctly find the 
graph shows upward tendency, and the deaths cases has an enormous increase approximately from 3/19/2020 to 4/18/2020. Another graph is a bar graph
which reveals everyday's total cases and recovered cases from 2/28/2020 until the latest day. The bar graphs of two kinds of cases are overlapped, which 
yields users compare different data conveniently.
